- In real life, you won't work in just one job, but in several, and each one will have different dependencies and requirements ðŸ¤”. 
- When dependencies are updated or the configuration of an environment with multiple associated projects changes, errors may occur ðŸ›‘. 
- To separate projects, what we do is create different virtual environments for each project ðŸ§ . Therefore, the configuration and updates are for each project.
- Virtual environment: A project that can have its own dependencies, regardless of the dependencies that other projects have (Scott Robinson and the folks at Real Python).

### Download Anaconda

```
https://www.anaconda.com/
```

```
wget -O anaconda.sh https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2024.02-1-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

### Install Anaconda

```
bash anaconda.sh
```

Remember:
- Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3 by running conda init? [yes | no]
	- YES

### Create virtual environments

List environments of conda:
```
conda env list
```

Create virtual environment:
```
conda create --name [name of environment] [package]=[version]
```

Example:
```
conda create --name nameOfEnvironment python=3.5 pandas
```

Activate environment:
```
conda activate [name of environment]
```

Example:
```
conda activate nameOfEnvironment
```

See specific version of each library
```
conda list pandas
```

Install specific package:
```
conda install [name of package]=[version]
```

Example:
```
conda install pandas=1.2
```

Update libraries:
```
conda update [package]=[version]
```

Example:
```
conda update python
```

Copy configurations:
```
conda create --name [new environment name] --copy --clone [old evironment name]
```

Example:
```
conda create --name py39 --copy --clone py35
```
